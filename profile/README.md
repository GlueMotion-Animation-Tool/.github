## About GlueMotion
GlueMotion is a dedicated stop motion animation application that brings traditional frame-by-frame animation techniques into the digital workflow. It provides a comprehensive environment for creating stop motion projects, from simple animated GIFs to complex video sequences with sound and effects. The application addresses the technical challenges of stop motion animation by offering tools that streamline the capture process, ensure frame consistency, and provide immediate visual feedback. Unlike general video editing software, GlueMotion is specifically designed for the unique workflow of stop motion, with features optimized for capturing, arranging, and refining sequences of individual frames.

The application excels in making stop motion animation accessible while providing professional-level control. The onion skinning feature, essential for smooth animation, displays previous frames as translucent overlays, helping animators position elements consistently across frames. Live view monitoring allows real-time preview through connected cameras, while features like auto-capture with time-lapse intervals support different animation styles. The timeline interface provides intuitive control over frame timing, while export options cater to various distribution needs from social media GIFs to high-definition video. For educators, hobbyists, and professional animators working with physical objects, clay, or cut-out animation, GlueMotion provides a focused toolset that simplifies technical aspects so creators can focus on artistic expression.
